           <td><P> Technology today is evolving at a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress, 
            causing an acceleration of the rate of changeIn the last 60 years, technology has advanced leaps and bounds. From a one ton machine which could store 3.5 MB data(IBM 350) to an SD card which can store 2 Terabytes of data and weighs only 2 grams, we have come a long way.
            One thing which has remained constant throughout this time is change.More and more students enroll in computer science. As they are completely different fields but they are interdependent on each other. Also, it is due to science contribution we can create new innovation and build new technological tools. Apart from that, the research conducted in laboratories contributes a lot to the development of technologies. On the other hand, technology extends the agenda of science.Software development is constantly evolving and will continue to do so in the coming months. Technological and societal needs are driving many of the changes we’re likely to see. For example, the need for a secure way to execute contracts is pushing blockchain to the next level, while new uses for artificial intelligence (AI) are forcing the industry to become more concerned about “ethical AI.” 
            .Regularly evolving technology has become an important part of our lives. Also, newer technologies are taking the market by storm and the people are getting used to them in no time. Above all, technological advancement has led to the growth and development of nationsThe use of technologies has enhanced the teaching-learning activities. Students actively take part in the visual learning process through animations using various software and programs. They can surf various learning websites, collect data and information related to their course content, and can also take different online tutorials. Moreover, technology also saves time for people and makes them more productive  </P>

       <P> Technological evolution is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development. ... Technology (which Richta defines as "a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value") evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation.
        Technology is born with the accomplishment of scientific progress and breakthroughs. However, the exact definition of technology varies according to context.Technology can be defined as the application of scientific knowledge to change and manipulate the human environment.
        Technology can also be defined as the branch of knowledge that caters to the creation and use of technical means and their relationship with society and environment, using engineering, applied and pure science.
        The sum of ways in which social groups provide themselves with material objects of their civilization.Technology is one of the greatest tools for mankind, however, it has the potential to be misused. Technology can also cause some jobs to become obsolete, causing unemployment. Moreover, current technology needs to focus on being more eco-friendly and minimize their carbon footprints. This is the only way to ensure that technology does not result in the destruction of our natural resources and eventually, our planet. </P>

This is potentially beneficial to ones communicating skills and general knowledge. It allows you to create and maintain relationships with people.
            Technology has allowed people to become self-employed or entrepreneurs. This development is the result of our many technological devices, however, we can not live without them. They are harmful to society in general and private users. Although the technology has facilitated us a lot of things of our lives, we have some negative effects, and that does not mean in any way to do without them, but emphasizes the need for the ban when used. Computer, for example, is a technological product most dangerous to carry most of these aspects is good and harmful. As for television, it is the source of a very basic and important contact, if not the most important.Technology and certain websites allow for one to promote themselves and their business. It had created many new job opportunities. It also offers a new form of advertising where you can literally record how many people see your advert and are able to spread it to a much wider audience.
            It has changed the way humans work. All communication is now done through emails and all banking is done online. People are even able to work from home and send their work in. This has speed up the rate at which work is done and created new job opportunities such as IT technicians.  </P>

        </font>
           <td><P>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the terms of computer science. This discusses some points on the basis of which we can differentiate between these two terms. 

            Overview 
            
            Artificial Intelligence: The word Artificial Intelligence comprises of two words “Artificial” and “Intelligence”. Artificial refers to something which is made by human or non natural thing and Intelligence means ability to understand or think. There is a misconception that Artificial Intelligence is a system, but it is not a system. AI is implemented in the system. There can be so many definition of AI, one definition can be “It is the study of how to train the computers so that computers can do things which at present human can do better.”Therefore It is a intelligence 
            where we want to add all the capabilities to machine that human contain.
            Machine Learning: Machine Learning is the learning in which machine can learn by its own without being explicitly programmed. It is an application of AI that provide system the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience. Here we can generate a program by integrating input and output of that program. One of the simple definition of the Machine Learning is “Machine Learning is said to learn from experience E w.r.t some class of task T and a performance measure P if learners performance at the task in the class as measured by P improves with experiences.AI with ML is impacting a lot of industries by collecting a lot of data and giving some information that can be used in the further decision-making process. Below are some reasons why AI and ML hold the future of the industries.  

            AI/Ml are driving an era of automation that holds important benefits for global industries like increased productivity.
            AI/ML brings in speed, as companies have started relying on technologies to optimize their internal business operations.
            AI/ML boosts creativity and innovation by automating tasks so that employees only focus on the essential part.
            AI/ML also can handle and analyze enormous data in an unbiased manner.”   </P>

           BLOCKCHAIN
        </h2>
       <td><img src = "blockchain-uses-cryptocurrency.png"height = "500" width="625" ></td>
       <td><P> Blockchain is the backbone Technology of Digital CryptoCurrency BitCoin. 
      
           The blockchain is a distributed database of records of all transactions or digital event that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction verified by the majority of participants of the system. It contains every single record of each transaction. BitCoin is the most popular cryptocurrency an example of the blockchain. Blockchain Technology first came to light when a person or Group of individuals name ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ published a white paper on “BitCoin: A peer to peer electronic cash system” in 2008. Blockchain Technology Records Transaction in Digital Ledger which is distributed over the Network thus making it incorruptible.
            Anything of value like Land Assets, Cars, etc. can be recorded on Blockchain as a Transaction.
        How Blockchain Technology works?
        One of the famous use of Blockchain is Bitcoin. The bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and is used to exchange digital assets online. Bitcoin uses cryptographic proof instead of third-party trust for two parties to execute transactions over the internet. Each transaction protects through digital signature. The whole point of using a blockchain is to let people — in particular, people who don't trust one another — share valuable data in a secure, tamperproof way. 
        Blockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes and miners.

        Blocks
        Every chain consists of multiple blocks and each block has three basic elements:
        
        The data in the block.
        A 32-bit whole number called a nonce. The nonce is randomly generated when a block is created, which then generates a block header hash. 
        The hash is a 256-bit number wedded to the nonce. It must start with a huge number of zeroes (i.e., be extremely small).
        When the first block of a chain is created, a nonce generates the cryptographic hash. The data in the block is considered signed and forever tied to the nonce and hash unless it is mined.  
        
        Miners
        Miners create new blocks on the chain through a process called mining.
        
        In a blockchain every block has its own unique nonce and hash, but also references the hash of the previous block in the chain, so mining a block isn't easy, especially on large chains.
        
        Miners use special software to solve the incredibly complex math problem of finding a nonce that generates an accepted hash. Because the nonce is only 32 bits and the hash is 256, there are roughly four billion possible nonce-hash combinations that must be mined before the right one is found. When that happens miners are said to have found the "golden nonce" and their block is added to the chain. 
        
        Making a change to any block earlier in the chain requires re-mining not just the block with the change, but all of the blocks that come after. This is why it's extremely difficult to manipulate blockchain technology. Think of it as "safety in math" since finding golden nonces requires an enormous amount of time and computing power.
        
        When a block is successfully mined, the change is accepted by all of the nodes on the network and the miner is rewarded financially.
        
      
        Nodes
One of the most important concepts in blockchain technology is decentralization. No one computer or organization can own the chain. Instead, it is a distributed ledger via the nodes connected to the chain. Nodes can be any kind of electronic device that maintains copies of the blockchain and keeps the network functioning. 

Every node has its own copy of the blockchain and the network must algorithmically approve any newly mined block for the chain to be updated, trusted and verified. Since blockchains are transparent, every action in the ledger can be easily checked and viewed. Each participant is given a unique alphanumeric identification number that shows their transactions.

Combining public information with a system of checks-and-balances helps the blockchain maintain integrity and creates trust among users. Essentially, blockchains can be thought of as the scalability of trust via technology.</P>

           Internet OF things

       <td><P>Internet of Things (IoT) is the networking of physical objects that contain electronics embedded within their architecture in order to communicate and sense interactions amongst each other or with respect to the external environment. In the upcoming years, IoT-based technology will offer advanced levels of services and practically change the way people lead their daily lives. Advancements in medicine, power, gene therapies, agriculture, smart cities, and smart homes are just a very few of the categorical examples where IoT is strongly established. 
        When we talk about IoT, we usually talk about M2M (machine-to-machine) relationships but M2M is not everything. The most important aspect is cloud. Via cloud only the machines can access data anytime anywhere and work without any glitches and give smooth outputs. The data transfers are conducted through sensors.

        Let us understand through an example. Suppose the electric cables used on metro train bridges are made up of copper from inside and that copper is replaced by smart copper. Smart copper is nothing but copper having sensors which are wirelessly connected to cloud which is later connected to machines wirelessly. So in future if there will be any breakage or any other kind of physical or functional damage to the wire, the sensors will record and transfer relevant report to the respective authority wirelessly via cloud. This whole process will help the system in three ways:
        
        • Physical labour and time can be saved in finding the problem in the wire
        • Instead of changing the whole wire, only parts effected can be monitored and changed
        • Daily report of wires which may include its temperature, tension and even amount of current transferred can be received.
        
        Even in future if the wire is covered with snow, this can also be monitored and dotted down wirelessly.Thus, on the whole, the Internet of Things is the technology that enables everything to communicate by themselves over the internet through devices without the use of computers. Here comes the most essential and prevalent term in IoT called ‘Smart’ which means Automation – the process of decreasing human intervention or involvement thereby increasing the machine intelligence to perform every task by itself, which could be done by IoT. 

        IoT makes an intertwined network of artificial things like physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and even to connect with natural living beings like plants, animals, and so on.

          VIRTUAL REALITY/AUGMENTED REALITY

       <td><P>Virtual Reality (VR): The word ‘virtual’ means something that is conceptual and does not exist physically and the word ‘reality’ means the state of being real. So the term ‘virtual reality’ is itself conflicting. It means something that is almost real. 

        We will probably never be on the top of Mount Everest or dive deep into the Mariana Trench or step on the Moon, but we might be able to do all these things without even stepping out of our homes, this is where Virtual Reality comes to the rescue. 
        
        In simple words, Virtual Reality means we can experience things that never actually happen. It actually tricks our brain into thinking that we are in a different place using 3 of our senses-seeing, hearing, and touching. It creates a different world, and we feel we are a part of it, both physically and mentally. 
        
        Virtual Reality (VR) has a lot of applications, some of them are:  
        
        Entertainment-Used for gaming, 3D cinema, and in theme parks. 
        Medicine-Used for surgery training, exposure therapy for people with phobia or anxiety disorder. 
        Skill training-Used for astronaut training, flight training, military training, etc. 
        Augmented Reality (AR): The word ‘augmented’ means to add. It might not sound as exciting as VR but has impacted our lives deeply. Augmented reality uses different tools to make the real and existing environment better and provides an improved version of reality. 
        
        Snapchat filters, Instagram filters, Pokemon Go are all Examples of AR. It is these AR apps that allow a customer to place virtual furniture in their house before buying. Projection-based AR applications allow human interaction by sending light onto a real surface and then sensing human touch, learning has become way more interesting and easy with AR, markerless AR provides data based on our location, it is also a powerful tool for marketing as it allows users to try products before buying. 
        
        Mixed Reality (MR): It brings real-world and digital elements together. But wait, this is what AR does, so what is the difference? 
        It integrates digital objects and real-world in such a way that it makes it look like the objects really belong there. 
        Mixed Reality works by scanning our physical environment and creating a map of our surroundings so that the device will know exactly how to place digital content into that space –realistically –allowing us to interact with it. 
        
        A few Examples of MR apps are: 
        
        An app that allows users to place notes around their environment. 
        A television app placed in comfortable spots for viewing. 
        A cooking app placed on the kitchen wall. 
        Microsoft’s Hololens is also a famous example of MR. 
        One common thing between all the above forms of technology is that they change the way we perceive real-world objects. All of these are trying to connect the real world and virtual tools, helping us improve our productivity </P></td>

       <td><P>Computers are getting smaller and faster day by day because electronic components are getting smaller and smaller. But this process is about to meet its physical limit. 

        Electricity is the flow of electrons. Since the size of transistors is shrinking to the size of a few atoms, transistors cannot be used as switches because electrons may transfer themselves to the other side of blocked passage by the process called quantum tunneling. 
        
        Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that explores the physical world at a most fundamental level. At this level, particles behave differently from the classical world taking more than one state at the same time and interacting with other particles that are very far away. Phenomena like superposition and entanglement take place. 
        
         
        
        Superposition – 
        In classical computing, bits have two possible states either zero or one. In quantum computing, a qubit (short for “quantum bit”) is a unit of quantum information—the quantum analogue to a classical bit. Qubits have special properties that help them solve complex problems much faster than classical bits. One of these properties is superposition, which states that instead of holding one binary value (“0” or “1”) like a classical bit, a qubit can hold a combination of “0” and “1” simultaneously. Qubits have two possible outcomes zero or one but those states are a superposition of zero and one. In the quantum world, qubits don’t have to be in one of those states. It can be in any proportion of those states. As soon as we measure its value it has to decide whether it is zero or one. This is called superposition. It is the ability of the quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time. 
        In classical computing for example there are 4 bytes. The combination of 4 bytes can represent 2^4=16 values in total and one value a given instant. But in a combination of 4 qubits, all 16 combinations are possible at once.
        
        Entanglement – 
        Entanglement is an extremely strong correlation that exists between quantum particles — so strong, in fact, that two or more quantum particles can be linked in perfect unison, even if separated by great distances. The particles remain
        perfectly correlated even if separated by great distances. Two qubits are entangled through the action of the laser. Once they have entangled, they are in an indeterminate state. The qubits can then be separated by any distance, they will remain linked. When one of the qubits is manipulated, the manipulation happens instantly to its entangled twin as well.
        What can quantum computers do? 
         
        
        Quantum computers can easily crack the encryption algorithms used today in very little time whereas it takes billions of years to best supercomputer available today. Even though quantum computers would be able to crack many of today’s encryption techniques, predictions are that they would create hack-proof replacements.
        Quantum computers are great for solving optimization problems.  </P>
